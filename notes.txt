sudo raspi-config -> interface options -> I2C (enable)

**may need to adjust switches on nfc board
00 = hsu
10 = i2c <--this one
01 = sp1

i2cdetect -y 1
**This should output a grid that shows the i2c address

sudo apt install libnfc6 libnfc-bin libnfc-examples

sudo nano /etc/nfc/libnfc.config
**add to end of file
device.name = "PN532"
device.connstring = "pn532_i2c:/dev/i2c-1"

nfc-scan-device
**should list device


nfc-poll

sudo apt-get install python3-pyaudio portaudio19-dev
pip install pyaudio
pip install gpiozero --upgrade

git clone https://github.com/mholgatem/py532lib --depth 1

pypi.org/search is also useful for looking up packages to install with pip since `pip search' has been deprecated for whatever reason
